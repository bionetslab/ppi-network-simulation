# PPI network simulation under study bias

Simulates the measurement process of observed PPI networks under study bias as described in the manuscript 
"Emergence of power law distributions in protein-protein interaction networks through study bias".

- To generate the plots shown in the manuscript, execute the workflow in the notebook `plot_results.ipynb`.
- To reproduce the results of the simulation study, ADD DESCRIPTION. **Attention: this will take several weeks.**
